#  Black Friday Sales Prediction

##  Description

I am delighted to present my latest Data Science project: **Black Friday Sales Prediction**.

The aim of this project is to **predict the purchase amount** of customers during Black Friday sales events.  
The journey begins with an **exhaustive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the impact of key features such as:

- Gender  
- Age  
- Occupation  
- City Category  
- Stay in Current City Years  
- Marital Status  
- Product Category  

on customer purchase behavior.

 The project uses **advanced data encoding techniques**, including:

- **Label Encoding**  
- **One-Hot Encoding**  

to transform categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models.

To maintain data integrity and quality, **missing values are handled using imputation techniques**, ensuring data completeness for reliable analysis and modeling.

##  Model Building

This project applies two powerful machine learning algorithms:

- **Decision Tree Regressor**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  

These models are trained on the preprocessed dataset to accurately predict purchase amounts based on customer and product-related features.

##  Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV  
- Adding additional product or customer demographic features  
- Comparing model performance using Cross-Validation  
- Model deployment using Streamlit or Flask
